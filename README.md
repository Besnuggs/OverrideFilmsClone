<p>A clone of a local film production company's website, overridefilms.com, with added e-commerce functionality in the form of a mock-shop and cart. This was an exercise in styling by learning new techniques such as Parallax, manipulating video dimensions as a background, and adding CSS transformation properties to employee cards for 3-D flip animations. This was built in 2 weeks. </p>
